Rubato comes with 4 folders:
- Frameworks: contains third party Libraries. 
Install them in one of the standard locations: that is ~/Library/Frameworks for single users, /Library/Frameworks for all users of one computer (you must be the administrator of that computer) or /Network/Library/Frameworks for all computers in a network (you must be the network administrator).

- Rubato.app: The Applicaton. 
Move it anywhere you want. Standard locations would be ~/Applications  or /Applications or /Network/Applications

- Rubettes: Loadable Modules for Rubato.
- Operators: Loadable Modules for the Performance-Rubette.
A easy way to install the Rubettes and Operators is to move the Rubato folder containing the Rubette and Operators folders to ~/Library.
You can set the Path to the Rubettes and Operators after starting Rubato.app with the Preferences-Menu.
