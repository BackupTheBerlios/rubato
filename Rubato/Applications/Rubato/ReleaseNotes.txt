Install:
  Frameworks in Frameworks(Private)

In PBX we normally set Framework Installation Location under Build Settings to @executable_path/../Frameworks, where @executable_path stands for App.app/Contents/MacOS/App, so @executable_path/../Frameworks is App.app/Contents/Frameworks
In the App-Project we do a copy Files Build Phase of the build Frameworks to "Frameworks"

We have several Choices to install the Rubettes and Frameworks to. One would be to follow the Apple convention to put them right into Rubato.app/Contents. Another would be to make the difference clear to the user and make it easier to install new Rubettes and provide a real Directory "Rubato". As a third solution, we could put some Frameworks in Rubato (not shared) and some outside. We do not adopt to Apples "Shared Frameworks" policy until we see Rubatos frameworks in a stable and versioned condition.

Installation: install all at somewhere/Rubato, where somewhere may be "/Library/Application Support"
somewhere/Rubato/Rubato.app
somewhere/Rubato/Rubettes
somewhere/Rubato/Operators

In the current version, we have all common Frameworks to reside within Rubato and PerformanceScore inside Performance.rubette. It could be interesting to have a common location for frameworks shared among Rubettes:
Set Framework and other search paths to somewhere/Rubato. Get two options for install:
1. One click install: copy Rubato-Folder anywhere.
2. More clicks install: move Applications from /Rubato/Applications to common Applications folder AND move Frameworks to common Framework path (/Library/Frameworks or $HOME/Frameworks)
